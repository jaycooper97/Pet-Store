He's a four-year-old Tiger Tabby who actually really loves to roughhouse and play.  He gets the zoomies quite often, so you'll hear him run around as fast as he can throughout the day.  He loves to be cuddled and held, but he also likes to use a Cat Catcher Teaser Wand to play.  Tiger also loves a good cat treat every once in a while, preferably the Fancy Feast Appitizers (his favorite is scallops); he's extremely food motivated.  If you're looking for a rambunctious but sweet cat, Tiger is the right fur friend for you!</p>
