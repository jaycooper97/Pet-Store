                                the children! She loves a good game of tug-o-war, and she has a great sense of sight and
                                smell, to help you perceive danger. Lola is fully trained (potty as well), and will be a

                                people, and great with children. She sits in the window sills, soaking in as much
                                sunlight as possible (the warmth feels good). She follows her family members around,

                                Sagwa keeps to herself sometimes, but she always comes out of hiding when she hears the
                                sound of her food bowl. She's great at comforting her household, since she loves to be
                                held and cuddled. You'll never feel alone with Sagwa around; she senses her family's emotional distress!</p>

                                zoomies quite often, but also likes to use a Cat Catcher Teaser Wand to play. Still
                                loves cuddles, and loves a good cat treat every once in a while (Fancy Feast
