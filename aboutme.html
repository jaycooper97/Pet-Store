    <h1 id="head">Learn about our beginning!</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="first">We as animal lovers were saddened by how many strays we were seeing on the streets everyday. We wanted
        to help as many fur babies as we could!
        That's our main goal: to get as many stary animals off of the street and somewhere safe as we could. In the
        beginning, we were strictly an animal
        shelter to help these animals have a safe and warm place to live. Eventually, it got to a point where we were
        completely full.
        From that point, we decided to start an adoption agency within the shelter to find these precious babies loving
        homes to go to.
        There are so many animals in this world that don't have anyone to love them, and it's our duty to help them find
        people that will!</p>
